## Known issues and improvement possibilities
- The frontend is a bit raw. I concentrated mainly on the backend functionality.
- The frontend JS is not structured into modules to keep it short and simple. If the logic is getting more complex, it will need a better structure.
- It is also possible to use any kind of frontend framework but I think it would be an overkill for this task.
